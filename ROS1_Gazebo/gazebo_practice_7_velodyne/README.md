# Practice 7 : Building Gazebo model of Velodyne LiDAR

Find dimension data and sensor data from datasheet.

Build links based on the information provided by the datasheet.

Use joints to connect links and to define their kinematic characteristics within SDF file.

Use < sensor > tag within link in order to apply sensor characteristics upon the link. Write sensor characteristics based on the sensor information provided by the datasheet.
