# Practice 4 : How to create Gazebo model using SDF

In order to create custom model, each model needs config and SDF/URDF.    
config file describes basic properties (SDF version, path to SDF file, author, version, etc)    
SDF/URDF file defines kinematic characteristics (size, collision box, geometry, visual properties, etc)

- SDF : Describe robots, models, simulation environment

- URDF : Describe only single robot
